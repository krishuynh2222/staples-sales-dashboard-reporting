## 💡 Key Insights  
1. **Revenue vs Margin**: Sales $2.3M, profit $286K; margin steady at 12% (▼5.1% YoY).  
2. **Category Mix**: Technology (51% profit) and Office Supplies (43%) dominate; Furniture weak despite volume.  
3. **Seasonality**: Q4 accounts for >35% of annual sales → over-reliance on holiday peaks.  
4. **Regional Gap**: East & West drive growth; Central & South underperform.  
5. **Product Concentration**: Top 5 sub-categories >55% of sales → risk of SKU dependence.

## 🚀 Actions  
- **Margin Recovery**: Limit discounts in Furniture; renegotiate suppliers.  
- **Smooth Seasonality**: Build Q1 campaigns to reduce Q4 dependence.  
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Bundle high-margin Technology (Phones + Accessories).  
- **Regional Expansion**: Pilot marketing in Central & South.  
- **Retention Strategy**: Loyalty program to lift repeat purchases.
